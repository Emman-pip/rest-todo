* RESTFUL TODO list
This project is to practice the integration of a REST architecture\


** How it would work
The API will be written using Python (Flask) and the frontend will be made using tailwindcss, html, and vanilla Javascript.


** Features
The todo list will be a minimal one. It will only include the following features:
1. A single to do list
2. CRUD operations on the database through API calls

   
** Next iterations
This section will cover the features to be implemented on the next iterations of the application.
1. A user login system that will include authorization tokens.
2. TODO lists for groups


** Database
MongoDB will be used as the database of the application. The collections and their related structures will be pasted here once the application is done.
